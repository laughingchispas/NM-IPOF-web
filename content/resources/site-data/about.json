        "body": "<p>What does it mean to be a Millenial and a classically-trained musician? Raised on the internet, around open-source concepts, and to embody some of the most progressive political and social values in history, we are classical musicians who are a unique product of our generation. Concretely, this translates into the ideas of collaboration, expansion, and genre-blending. Despite a lifetime of classical training, we do not close the door to collaboration with other genres, we thrive on it. Anything is allowed.</p><p>Brussels-based, we are a group of classically-trained strings who had continually crossed paths in projects spanning the poles from Bluegrass chop techniques, jazz improvisation, minimalism, baroque, theater, pop, symphonic orchestra to electronica. In a desire to funnel this passion for the classical, the non-classical and the collaborative, In Praise of Folly is a string quartet that offers a shared desire to bring the unique color of strings to a non-classical domain by supporting the unique worldsâ€™ of pop artists. And at the same time, a drive to contribute to the world of classical music is the motivating factor for our work with young Millenial composers to create new, contemporary chamber music.</p><p>With over 100 years combined experience playing classical and non-classical music, we perform on stage and in the studio with independent, rock, and pop bands in Europe and beyond. While able to perform acoustically, we are also well-versed in performing using amplification, in-ear microphones or on clicks, reading traditional sheet music as well as chord charts and from memory. We can also provide backup vocals, some secondary instruments, and string arrangements.</p>"
